              <h1>Hello! I am <span>Chisom</span> </h1>

              <p> I am a professional product designer passionate about
                  creating simple and accessible digital experiences 
                  that translate business objectives into solutions.
              </p>
              
              <p>I push products to the next level through a design
                process that includes data-backed user research, 
                rapid iteration, and visually stunning user-focused UI.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                I've worked on digital solutions/products ranging 
                from company’s internal software, B2B products, 
                to eCommerce websites, Fintech, and e-learning platforms.
            </p>

            <p>I’m always ready to work on interesting and meaningful
              projects with people and businesses all over the world.
            </p>

            <p>When I'm not designing, you would find me binge-watching
              comedy movies, reading a book or sleeping.
            </p>

          <p>If you'd like to know more or have a project you'd like to discuss,
            don't hesitate to reach out: ifeanyichisomjane@gmail.com.
